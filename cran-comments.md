## Release summary
This is the first re-submission of our initial CRAN submission based on feedback from MatthiasÂ Sterrer. 

We have made the following changes:

1. add executable examples for `cs_prep_year()`, `cs_load_year()`, and `cs_projectXY`
2. in order to facilitate (1), we have added a `cs_example()` function for creating a sample year worth of `.csv` files
3. clarify `DESCRIPTION` for package based on the feedback we recieved

### Original summary
This package is a compliment to an existing CRAN package, `stlcsb`, which provides access to non-emergency call data. Though this package is focused on St. Louis, it provides access to detailed data about a city with one of the highest violent crime rates in the United States, an issue of interest to researchers both within St. Louis and nationally. It also provides categorization tools that are more broadly applicable to police data from around the United States.
