[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/compstatr)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=compstatr)

The goal of `compstatr` is to provide a suite of tools for working with crime data made public by the City of St. Louis's [Metropolitan Police Department](http://www.slmpd.org).

## Motivation
The St. Louis [Metropolitan Police Department](http://www.slmpd.org) makes it data freely available as a [series of downloadable](http://www.slmpd.org/Crimereports.shtml) `.csv` files. Each file corresponds to a month, beginning with February 2008. Those data are inconsistently organized, with all data before 2013 and some months of 2013 itself having eighteen variables. Beginning during 2013, most months have twenty variables, many of which are named differently from their pre-2014 counterparts. These inconsistencies, and the fact that working with their data requires mangaing over 120 spreadsheets, are the reason for `compstatr`.

## Installation

You can install compstatr from Github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("slu-openGIS/compStatR")
```

## Opionated Data Preparation
As of March 2018, the City's data is downloaded with an `.html` file extension. For our research purposes, we save the raw files by year into a folder called `data/rawData/html`. We then use a bash script called from an `R` notebook to copy all of these to a folder called `data/rawData/csv` and then loop through each year of the folder, removing the redundent file extension created when `January2008.csv.html` is downloaded. We then use a second loop to change the extension itself to `.csv`.

```bash
# copy html files new directory for csv
cp -r data/rawData/html/* data/rawData/csv

# change file extensions
for file in data/rawData/csv/2008/*.html
do
  mv "$file" "${file%%.*}.${file##*.}"
done

for file in data/rawData/csv/2008/*.html
do
 mv "$file" "${file%.html}.csv"
done
```

The `compstatr` package requires that data are saved in subfolders by year, though the folder hirearchy itself is up to you. It also requires that the files have been renamed from `January2008.csv.html` to `January2008.csv`. If you rename the files futher, the validation scripts will not work. We strongly suggest using a bash script or similar tool to do this in a reproducible, well documented fashion. 

## Useage
### Data Validation
The first step in working with the SLMPD data is to import it. Our approach with `compstatr` is to read into data a year at a time using `cs_load_year()`:

```r
data2008 <- cs_load_year(here("data", "rawData", "csv", "2008"))
```

The `cs_load_year()` function requires that all 12 months of data are present. It will load data into a single list object containing a tibble for each month. Months are ordered alphabetically, not numerically.
