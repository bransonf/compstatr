The goal of `compstatr` is to provide a suite of tools for working with crime data made public by the City of St. Louis's [Metropolitan Police Department](http://www.slmpd.org).

## Motivation
Among cities in the United States, St. Louis has the distinction of having the highest or one of the highest violent crime and homicide rates since 2010. It therefore presents an important site for social scientists, public health researchers, and health care providers as well as policy makers to understand the effects of violent crime on urban communities. 

The City's crime data, however, are diffuclt to work with and present a challenge for researchers. These data are inconsistently organized, with all data before 2013 and some months of 2013 itself having eighteen variables. Beginning during 2013, most (but not all) months have twenty variables, many of which are named differently from their pre-2014 counterparts. These inconsistencies, and the fact that working with their data requires mangaing over 120 spreadsheets that each download with with a `.html` file extension, are the motivating force behind `compstatr`.

We therefore provide a set of tools for accessing, preparing, editing, and mapping St. Louis [Metropolitan Police Department](http://www.slmpd.org) (SLMPD) crime data, which are available [on their website](http://www.slmpd.org/Crimereports.shtml) as `.csv` files.
