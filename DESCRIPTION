Description: Among cities in the United States, St. Louis has the 
    distinction of having the highest or one of the highest violent crime 
    and homicide rates since 2010. It therefore presents an important site
    for social scientists, public health researchers, and health care
    providers as well as policy makers to understand the effects of violent
    crime on urban communities. The City's crime data, however, are difficult
    to work with and present a number of challenges for researchers. We therefore provide
    a set of tools for accessing and editing St. Louis Metropolitan Police 
    Department (SLMPD) crime data, which are available on their website in csv form. 
    The categorization tools that are provided will work with any police department 
    that uses 5 and 6 digit numeric codes to identify specific crimes.
